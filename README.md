# Windows WavBall

![Cover](https://github.com/HarryJamesGreenblatt/WavBall/blob/main/WavBall/Assets/Images/Cover.png?raw=true)

A real-time audio spectrum visualizer and physics game for Windows built with WPF and .NET 9. Captures system audio output via WASAPI loopback and renders a mel-scale frequency bar visualization that responds to any audio playing through the default output device — Spotify, browsers, games, etc. Toggle on **Rain**, a **Ball**, or full **Game Mode** to layer interactive physics on top of the spectrum.

## Features

- **WASAPI Loopback Capture** — taps into the default audio output device with zero configuration
- **Mel-Scale FFT** — 64-band spectrum mapped to human-perceived frequency spacing via NWaves
- **Accent-Aware Theming** — bar gradient automatically matches your Windows accent color
- **Peak Hold with Gravity** — floating peak indicators rise instantly and fall with simulated gravity
- **Tear-Free Rendering** — lock-free double-buffered pipeline between the audio capture thread and WPF compositor
- **Low Latency** — 1024-sample FFT window (~21ms) with fast-attack smoothing for tight transient response
- **Interactive Ball Physics** — 23 unique ball types with Newtonian physics, drag-and-throw interaction, and collision against the live spectrum surface. Difficulty progression from Beach Ball (mascot, always first) through Super Ball, Ping Pong, Racquetball, Wiffle Ball, and 17 more — all the way to the Cannonball final boss.
- **Audio-Driven Rain** — variable-size raindrops with parallax depth, bass-driven wind, snare-burst spawning, and motion-blur trail rendering
- **Game Mode** — stage-based progression: guide each ball into a golden goal ring using the music itself as the playing field, with anti-cheat and particle burst scoring effects
- **Autonomous Goal Agent** — the goal is a "mosquito" that hunts for musical energy: a two-dimensional appetite machine (Charge sensor + Satiety integrator) cycles between Feeding (proximity-weighted loudest band) and Sated (retreats to a randomized altitude above the action via anti-centroid X), so it migrates across the playing field on a polyrhythmic schedule rather than locking to one peak
- **Dual-Layer Goal Visual** — a cool cyan halo that grows with appetite-cycle state and pulses with bass kicks, around a warm gold ring that deforms into an oscilloscope-style squiggle on snare hits (high-frequency sinusoidal radial perturbation with exponential ring-out) — geometric shape encodes transient energy while brightness encodes collidability
- **Per-Band Thermal Luminosity** — bars glow brighter with sustained activity; treble bands charge faster
- **WMP9-Inspired Shell** — three-row Windows Media Player 9 ("Corona") chrome, with layout and sprite positions derived from the original `Corona.wms` skin layout spec. Blue metallic chrome frame (gradient sampled from `equalizer_middle.png`) around the visualizer with metallic bevel separators. Transport chrome panel uses the original `equalizer_left/middle/right` bitmaps as background, with the full `transports.png` atlas (136×30) rendered as a single image — per-button hover/down via clipped overlays. Pause is a 30×30 overlay at the play position. Rain toggle wired to the `>>` button with glow effect; mic toggle has a custom icon overlay. Palette sampled from the 2002 Microsoft sprite atlases.
- **Side Panel** — WMP9-style info panel: ball sprite icon (AI-generated photorealistic PNGs), physics stats (mass, restitution, radius in real-world units), LED round timer, and a pre-populated round history list (all 23 ball types visible from the start, "-" for uncompleted times, current ball highlighted amber). Now Playing section shows album art + track metadata from the active media session.
- **Goal Status HUD** — green LED strip below the visualizer shows real-time goal state: left indicator (◎ DISCHARGED / ◎ ARMED with gold blink) tracks collidability, right indicator (⚡ CHARGING / ⚡ OVERCHARGED with red blink) tracks the goal's feeding/sated appetite cycle.
- **System Volume Control** — master volume slider wired to the default audio endpoint via NAudio `MMDeviceEnumerator`; syncs bidirectionally with external changes (taskbar, hardware keys).
- **System Media-Key Integration** — the ◀ / ▶ buttons send `VK_MEDIA_PREV_TRACK` / `VK_MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK` globally, so they skip tracks in whatever app is currently playing (Spotify, browsers, Groove, foobar, etc.) without requiring focus or per-app integration.

└─────────────────┘                  └─────────────────────┘                 │  ball + rain      │
                                                                            └───────────────────┘
```

1. **AudioCaptureService** fires `AudioDataAvailable` on the WASAPI capture thread (~every 10ms)
2. **FftProcessingService** windows the signal, runs a 1024-point FFT, maps bins to 64 mel bands, applies a treble gain curve and square-root compression
3. **MainWindow** writes the result to a back buffer and atomically publishes it via `Interlocked.Exchange`
4. **WPF CompositionTarget.Rendering** (~60fps) grabs the latest complete frame and pushes it to the visualizer
5. **VisualizerElement** runs a 120Hz fixed-timestep game loop — bars react to audio, physics entities collide against the live spectrum surface, and everything renders each frame
